## Overview
This repository contains a bio-inspired algorithm, a firefly algorithm (FA), used to determine the best resource allocation in a self-organizing C-RAN architecture. In addition, in the plots folder, there are benchmarks with two other results found in the literature, one using [PSO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8364051) and the other using [BAT](https://iecom.org.br/encom2018/others/anais_encom2018.pdf) (p. 43-44).

The results found supported the elaboration of an article submitted for the event of the Brazilian telecommunications society (SBrT) of 2020.
